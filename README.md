# Expense tracker structure

1. **HTML**: Defines the structure of the expense tracker. It includes fields for entering the monthly target and daily expenses, and it has a section for displaying the summary and the chart.

2. **CSS**: Provides dark mode styling with some color pops for buttons and other elements. It ensures the UI is clean and visually appealing.

3. **JavaScript**: Manages the logic of the expense tracker. It allows users to set a target and record daily expenses, updates the summary, triggers alerts when the balance is low, and displays a bar chart of spending vs. remaining budget.

- **Daily Expense Tracking**: Add daily expenses and see how they impact the budget.
- **Alerts**: Get notified when you are approaching 40% of your budget.
- **Bar Chart**: Visual representation of total spending vs. remaining budget using Chart.js.
